# Natia Lollie's Web Development Portfolio
---

Welcome to my portfolio! I have built this website to showcase my skills and expertise in artificial intelligence and web development. The idea for revamping my portfolio came to me while taking a Harvard Computer Science course that immersed students in the history of computer programming. Learning how the past has lead us to what we know as computer and web today was intensely interesting and became the main focus of my journey; I strongly believe that no matter how far we may go, a solid foundation should always be the start. My intention with this portfolio revamp is to honor that belief by merging the structures and resources the structures and assets of the past, with the elements and functionality of the present.
